## 📝 What is GhostType?

GhostType is a macOS app designed to let you talk and get things done faster. It uses built-in voice dictation, can rewrite what you say using smart AI, and translate your speech into other languages. It runs directly on your Mac with Apple Silicon chips, so everything happens locally—no need to worry about sending your voice online.

The app helps you turn speech into text, rearrange sentences, or convert words from one language to another—all inside one tool. It’s useful whether you want to write emails, notes, or just speed up typing with your voice.

- At least 4GB of RAM
- About 200 MB of free disk space
- A built-in microphone or an external mic connected to your Mac
